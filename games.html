                <p>
                    50 Cent: Blood on the Sand is a third-person shooter video game developed by Swordfish Studios <br>
                    and published by THQ for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. <br>
                    It serves as the sequel to 50 Cent: Bulletproof, and was released in February 2009. <br>
                    The game centers around a fictional 50 Cent and G-Unit's concert, set in an unspecified location <br>
                    in Middle East. After the reward payment goes wrong, the group tries to retrieve the stolen <br>
                    skull back from the terrorists.<br>

Blood on the Sand came out of a Covert-One cancelled project at the developer studio,<br>
 tweaking it to be less serious.<br>
 In 2008, Vivendi Games, the previous publisher, merged with Activision in 2008. <br>
 That resulted in the company dropping Blood on the Sand, with an uncertain future regarding the release.<br>
  Shortly after, THQ took over the publishing rights for the game.

The game was positively received upon release, with praise directed at <br>
50 Cent's involvement. Despite being noted as an improvement over Bulletproof,<br>
 it was a commercial failure, which led to the closure of Swordfish Studios in 2010
