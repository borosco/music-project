                    Curtis Jackson, known as 50 Cent, is a<br> hip hop artist and businessman who became famous</br>
                     for his streetwise raps and rags-to-riches<br> life story. After an early life of crime, drugs</br>
                      and violence, he turned to rap, rocketing<br> to stardom with the album Get Rich or Die Tryin in 2003.<br>
                      One of the leading figures in early <br>21st-century "gangsta" rap, with side projects<br>
                       including the hip hop group G-Unit, <br>investments in soda water companies and video games, <br>
                       50 Cent has since branched out<br> to become an actor and businessman. <br>
                       His career has been littered with <br>feuds with other rappers, arrests and<br> 
                       legal and financial difficulties, <br>while his recent recording output has <br>
                       been sporadic.
