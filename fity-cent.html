            Curtis Jackson, known as 50 Cent, is a hip hop artist and businessman who became famous</br>
             for his streetwise raps and rags-to-riches life story. After an early life of crime, drugs</br.
              and violence, he turned to rap, 
              rocketing to stardom with the album Get Rich or Die Tryin' in 2003. <br>
              One of the leading figures in early 21st-century "gangsta" rap, with side projects<br>
               including the hip hop group G-Unit, investments in soda water companies and video games, <br>
               50 Cent has since branched out to become an actor and businessman. <br>
               His career has been littered with feuds with other rappers, arrests and<br> 
               legal and financial difficulties, while his recent recording output has <br>
               been sporadic.
